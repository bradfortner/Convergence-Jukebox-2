# Convergence-Jukebox-2
Update to the original Convergence Jukebox using a Kivy based GUI in place of Tkinter. Convergence Jukebox is a fully functional retro jukebox application. It emulates "physical" jukeboxes and is written in Python. The software has been designed to be fully functional, playing mp3's both randomly and via a credit system.
